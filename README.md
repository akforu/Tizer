# Tizer
The project Tizer is an automated ticket analyzer that uses machine learning algorithms to classify the tickets that are arisen by a client to an administrator of an IT service provider . The tickets can be arisen for only three reasons: Incident, Change and Problem. Our project analyses the tokens of descriptions and finds which category the ticket falls into .
